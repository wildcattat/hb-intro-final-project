# i wanted to do something graphical for the final project. For the past two weeks i was reseraching turtle and trying to understand the way i can define a project that will have graphical aspect and yet can leverage what we learned at class (for loops, while loops, dictionaries, lists, tupples, classes etc). i think i am starting to get a good idea and will soon describe the scenario and goal for the project.
